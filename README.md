# ProposIA Fullstack Project

This repository contains a simple fullstack setup with a Node.js/Express backend and a React frontend.

- **backend**: Express API with PostgreSQL (via `pg` driver)
- **frontend**: React application using `react-scripts`

## Getting Started

Each part has its own `package.json`. Install dependencies for both applications separately:

```bash
cd backend && npm install
cd ../frontend && npm install
```

Run the development servers:

```bash
# Backend
npm start

# Frontend
npm start
```
